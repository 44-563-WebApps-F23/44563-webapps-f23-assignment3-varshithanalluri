<h1>Sports i like and recommend </h1>
<p>Table describes about sports Table is about Sports which i recommend to play .Recomended  sports are are very nice and need not to spend more time on  while learning.
Playing a sport requires a lot of time and energy. Some people may think this would distract student-athletes from schoolwork. However, the opposite is true. Sports require memorization, repetition and learning — skillsets that are directly relevant to class work</p>
